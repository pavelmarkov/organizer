# Frondend library

`primeng` library was chosen instead of `ag grid`
`ag grid` has enterprise fearures such as tree tables and data grouping. These features, however, are open source and free to use in `primeng` library

`Angular` version was downgraded to 19.2.14 to be compatible with the latest `primeng` release
